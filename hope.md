# Hope

## Adventus

Today is the start of the season of Advent. It's the beginning of the Christian calendar, and the Christmas season, but where did we get the word? The Latin word *adventus* is the noun for "coming" or "arrival." Literally, it's the noun version of "coming (ventus) to (ad)." We use the word "advent" in secular context as well: "the advent of the printing press" or "the advent of the internet." Inventions like these have changed the world in large ways, but the Advent season celebrates the greatest invention of all time: Love coming to planet Earth.

> The Word became flesh and blood,
>     and moved into the neighborhood.
> We saw the glory with our own eyes,
>     the one-of-a-kind glory,
>     like Father, like Son,
> Generous inside and out,
>     true from start to finish.
>
> John 1:14 MSG

Into the neighborhood. Can you believe it? It's unlike any other story. God with skin on. God with us. It's my favorite translation of my favorite verse. There's no inventor like God.

The first week in Advent is all about Hope. What greater hope do we have than this? God sent his only son into our neighborhood.

*Creator of All Things, thank you for making your Word flesh. You're here in our neighborhood, and so we get to know you like a neighbor. Keep this hope in our hearts this Advent season and always. AMEN.*

## Hope is the thing with the feathers

> “Hope” is the thing with feathers -
> That perches in the soul -
> And sings the tune without the words -
> And never stops - at all -
>
> And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
> And sore must be the storm -
> That could abash the little Bird
> That kept so many warm -
>
> I’ve heard it in the chillest land -
> And on the strangest Sea -
> Yet - never - in Extremity,
> It asked a crumb - of me.
>
> Emily Dickinson

Meditate on this statement: in your darkest hour, God draws nearest to you. In fact, if your life is built on faith, you may draw nearest to God when you are at your lowest. It says as much in James 4:8, "Draw near to God and He will draw near to you." (NKJV).

Does this mean you need to remain stoic, pious, perfect in you suffering? Absolutely not. It's okay to be mad at God, at least for a time. It's okay to ask God for what you need, all the time. God doesn't want perfect little soldiers. Why then would he allow us to get into this big mess of Sin? No, God wants a relationship with you. Relationships have fights sometimes, but they also have joy.

This Advent season remember that God didn't come down to Earth to fix us and be done with the job. God became a little baby to, among other things, give us Hope. Hope for tomorrow. Hope for today. Hope to keep perfecting us, in each and every way.

*Caring Father, thank you for your gift of Hope. Help us to draw near to you this Christmas season, especially when we are at our lowest. AMEN.*

## Dum spiro, spero

*Dum spiro, spero.* A Latin proverb meaning, "While I breathe, I hope." From *spiro* (I breathe), we get words like inspire (to infuse into the mind). From *spero* (I hope), we get words like despair (the state of being without hope). I've always liked the proverb, but I don't think this is the whole story for believers. As followers of Jesus, we worship the Living God. While He is breathing life into us, we have hope, and he's always breathing life into us. In fact, it's Jesus' death on the cross and ultimate resurrection that is the basis for our hope.

I do, however, love the association of breathing and hoping. The association is captured in the Hebrew word *ruach*, which means "wind," "breath," or "spirit." You can find mention of God's ruach all over the Hebrew bible. It's on page one when “The Spirit of God [Ruach Elohim] was hovering over the waters” (Genesis 1:2). It's a through line all the way into the New Testament when, at Jesus' baptistm, Spirit of God descends and rests upon Him "like a dove" (Matthew 3:16). This was foretold in Isaiah 11:2: 

> And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,
> the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
> the Spirit of counsel and might,
> the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.

And praise God, we still sing about this today:

> Breathe on me, Breath of God,
> fill me with life anew,
> that I may love the way you love,
> and do what you would do.

*Living God, thank you for breathing life into us. While you breathe, we will place our hope in you. AMEM.*

## It's the hope that kills you

Last year, we started a new Men's Bible Study on Wednesday nights. We studied an unlikely subject, an Apple TV+ show called Ted Lasso. On the surface, this is not something you'd expect to study in a church setting, but Jimmy Mummert and I (and turns out many more) saw something deeper there: God's wisdom revealed through a modern, secular story. As Jimmy's friend put it during the peak of the pandemic, "It's a show that we need right now."

The show follows an unlikely hero, an American football coach who has found himself coaching a Premier League soccer team in England. He's a total fish out of water, but over the course of the season he and the team find redemption in one another. The climax of the season occurs when they are one win aways from avoiding relegation (being demoted to the minor leagues). Coach Ted gathers the team together at half time and gives this speech:

> So I've been hearing this phrase y'all got over here that I ain't too crazy about. "It's the hope that kills you." Y'all know that? I disagree, you know? I think it's the lack of hope that comes and gets you. See, I believe in hope. I believe in belief. Now, where I'm from, we got a saying too, yeah? A question, actually. "Do you believe in miracles?" Now, I don't need y'all to answer that question for me... but I do want you to answer that question for yourselves. Right now. Do you believe in miracles? And if you do... then I want y'all to circle up with me right now. Come on. Let's go.

Answer that question for yourself this advent season. Here's a hint though, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible." (Matthew 19:26)

*Miracle Maker, all things are possible with you. Don't let us forget this fact. We love you. AMEN.*

## Expecto patronum

The Harry Potter series is probably the most significant work of fiction for my generation. Many of us waited in line outside Barnes & Noble at each release, and many an Accelerate Redaer point was earned by reading these books. 

One of the most pivotal events in the series occurs in the third book.  By a lake in the Forbidden Forest, Harry is with Sirius Black, his newfound godfather, who has been gravely wounded. Sirius is the first true family that the orphan boy has ever known, and it seems like Sirius is about to be lost to him as quickly as he was found. As they huddle together, the lake ices over rapidly, and there descend hundreds of Dementors, ghastly wraithlike beings who devour human happiness. Harry tries to cast the Patronus spell, the only way to defeat a Dementor, but fails. It seems that all hope is lost.

Miraculously, across the lake, a shimmering white stag appears made from pure light. It drives away the Dementors and saves Harry and Sirius. Harry is convinced that his father has returned from the grave to save them. Only later we find out that Harry himself made a small jump back in time and saved himself with a stronger Patronus charm that appeared as his father's white stag.

What does all this have to do with Christmas? It's simple. Biblical hope is not wish fulfillment. Biblical hope is based on trust in God that has been developed over generations of believers. We read the Bible and know the stories of how God has shown up for his people. We experience God's presence in our own lives. We hold hope in our hearts that God will continue His good work going forward.

That's why I love this scene in Harry Potter. To cast the Patronus spell, Harry says, "Expecto patronum." It's the Latin for "I expect a guardian." When Harry travels back in time, he stands across the lake from his past self saying, "Dad will come. I saw him." After a short while, he realizes he must show up for himself because, paradoxically, he already has.

*Merciful Father, we thank you for all the times you have showed up for us in our past. We pray that this Christmas season you give us the hope, the expectation that you will show up for us in the days to come. AMEN.*

## Where does your hope lie?

As I'm writing this, we're in the middle of the 2024 election season, with no winners decided yet. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit jaded. But when I was asked to write Advent devotions about Hope, I remembered the 2008 election season. Do you remember the Barack Obama "Hope" poster? Street artist Shepard Fairey based the design on a photo taken an AP freelance photographer. The poster showed then-presidential-candidate Obama with his gaze lifted up, stylized in red, white, and blue with a bold block font "HOPE" at the base.

This image was everywhere back then, and it clearly resonated with many people. Some folks saw for the first time a presidential candidate that looked like them during the most serious economic downturn since the Great Depression. Looking back, I can't help but think about how many of folks were just like this during Jesus' time. First, I think of the Zealots, a revolutionary group who thought Jesus came to help them overthrow the Roman government. Next, there were the Essenes, who thought they could retreat from society to remain holy and pure. Then, there were the Pharisees, who were sure that strict adherence to the law was the only way forward. Finally, there were the Sadducees, who thought they were above the rest in both holiness and social status. The funny thing is, they all had one thing in common: none of them really understood what Jesus came to do.

Jesus came to change people's hearts, not their politics. With Jesus in your heart, everything changes, not just one dimmension of life. This Christmas, regardless of election outcomes or anything else, I pray that we experience revival in our hearts and that that would lead us to be the body of Christ in our community.

*Loving Jesus, help us to keep our hope in you, and you alone, this Christmas season. Divert our eyes from the squabbles of politics, and fix us on loving our neighbor as you love us. AMEN.*

## Hope for the Flowers

One of the best gifts I ever received was from my Sunday school teachers in 12th grade. It was a yellow book with a butterfly on it called *Hope for the Flowers* by Trina Paulus. The cover explained that it was a "a tale - partly about life, partly about revolution, and lots about hope - for adults and other including caterpillars who can read". If you can, read it yourself, but I'll try to summarize here.

The story follows a caterpillar named Stripe. He hatches from an egg, eats, and grows, but he has a feeling there must be more to life. One day he discovers a pillar of caterpillars, all climbing over one another, that stretches up to the clouds. They are seeking soem unknown goal. He joins in and along the way meets a friend, Yellow. They fall in love and eventually give up the climb to live together, but the feeling that there is more to life never leaves Stripe. Eventually, he sets back off to the climb, abandoning Yellow. Sad and alone, Yellow discovers another caterpillar forming a cocoon and, though doubtful, decides to do the same. Meanwhile, Stripe is bigger and stronger and makes it to the top of the climb to discover nothing but a clear vantage point with thousands of other caterpillar pillars around. Then, buttefly Yellow visits him. He doesn't understand at first but ultimately she convinces him to become a butterfly too, and they live happily ever after.

There's more depth to the parable than I can convey here, but there's a pivotal moment I want to zoom in on. The first cocoon-building caterpillar tells Yellow that to become a butterfly, "You must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpiller." Yellow asks them if this means she has to die. "Yes and No," he says. "Life is changed, not taken away." This is the ultimate hope-building move. Paul says it this way in Galatians 2:20, "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."

*Author of Hope, give us the courage to die to ourselves and take up our cross daily and follow you. AMEN.*
