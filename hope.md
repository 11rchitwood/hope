# Hope

## Adventus

Today is the start of the season of Advent. It's the beginning of the Christian calendar, and the Christmas season, but where did we get the word? The Latin word adventus is the noun for "coming" or "arrival." Literally, it's the noun version of "coming (ventus) to (ad)." We use the word "advent" in secular context as well: "the advent of the printing press" or "the advent of the internet." These inventions no doubt changed the world in large ways, but the Advent season celebrates the greatest invention of all time: Love coming to planet Earth.

> The Word became flesh and blood,
>     and moved into the neighborhood.
> We saw the glory with our own eyes,
>     the one-of-a-kind glory,
>     like Father, like Son,
> Generous inside and out,
>     true from start to finish.
>
> John 1:14 MSG

Into the neighborhood. Can you believe it? It's unlike any other story. God with skin on. God with us. It's my favorite translation of my favorite verse. There's no inventor like God.

The first week in Advent is all about Hope. What greater hope do we have than this? God sent his only son into our neighborhood.

*Creator of All Things, thank you for making your Word flesh. You're here in our neighborhood, and so we get to know you like a neighbor. Keep this hope in our hearts this Advent season and always. AMEN.*

## Hope is the thing with the feathers

> “Hope” is the thing with feathers -
> That perches in the soul -
> And sings the tune without the words -
> And never stops - at all -
>
> And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
> And sore must be the storm -
> That could abash the little Bird
> That kept so many warm -
>
> I’ve heard it in the chillest land -
> And on the strangest Sea -
> Yet - never - in Extremity,
> It asked a crumb - of me.
>
> Emily Dickinson

Meditate on this statement: in your darkest hour, God draws nearest to you. In fact, if your life is built on faith, you may draw nearest to God when you are at your lowest. It says as much in James 4:8, "Draw near to God and He will draw near to you." (NKJV).

Does this mean you need to remain stoic, pious, perfect in you suffering? Absolutely not. It's okay to be mad at God, at least for a time. It's okay to ask God for what you need, all the time. God doesn't want perfect little soldiers. Why then would he allow us to get into this big mess of Sin? No, God wants a relationship with you. Relationships have fights sometimes, but they also have joy.

This Advent season remember that God didn't come down to Earth to fix us and be done with the job. God became a little baby to, among other things, give us Hope. Hope for tomorrow. Hope for today. Hope to keep perfecting us, in each and every way.

*Loving Father, thank you for your gift of Hope. Help us to draw near to you this Christmas season, especially when we are at our lowest. AMEN.*

## Dum spiro, spero

Inspire. Despair.

While, I breathe, I hope. But this isn't the whole story for believers. We worship the Living God. While He is breathing life into us, we have hope, and he's always breathing life into us.

There's a Hebrew word for this, Ruach.

*Living God, thank you for breathing life into us. While you breathe, we will place our hope in you. AMEM.*

## It's the hope that kills you

Last year, we started a new Men's Bible Study on Wednesday nights. We studied an unlikely subject, an Apple TV+ show called Ted Lasso. On the surface, this is not something you'd expect to study in a church setting, but Jimmy Mummert and I (and turns out many more) saw something deeper there: God's wisdom revealed through a modern, secular story. As Jimmy's friend put it during the peak of the pandemic, "It's a show that we need right now."

The show follows an unlikely hero, an American football coach who has found himself coaching a Premier League soccer team in England. He's a a total fish out of water, but over the course of the season he and the team find redemption in one another. The climax of the season occurs when they are one win aways from avoiding relegation (being demoted to the minor leagues). Coach Ted gathers the team together at half time and gives this speech:

> So I've been hearing this phrase y'all got over here that I ain't too crazy about. "It's the hope that kills you." Y'all know that? I disagree, you know? I think it's the lack of hope that comes and gets you. See, I believe in hope. I believe in belief. Now, where I'm from, we got a saying too, yeah? A question, actually. "Do you believe in miracles?" Now, I don't need y'all to answer that question for me... but I do want you to answer that question for yourselves. Right now. Do you believe in miracles? And if you do... then I want y'all to circle up with me right now. Come on. Let's go.

Answer that question for yourself this advent season. Here's a hint though, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible." (Matthew 19:26)

*Miracle Maker, all things are possible with you. Don't let us forget this fact. We love you. AMEN.*

## Expecto patronum

I expect a guardian.

Come, though long expected Jesus,

## Where does your hope lie?

People found hope in Obama. People found hope in Jesus. As I'm writing this in September 2024, we don't know who will be the next president. We do know who is truly sovereign in our lives. Let's pray that our nation's leaders will be good stewards of the country we've ellected them to serve, but more than that let's cling to the hope the Christ gives us.

## Hope for the flowers

Growing up, I benefitted from a lot of Bill Turner's legacy. One special part was Sunday School at St. Luke my senior year in high school. Mr. Turner was no longer teaching, but his proteges, Betsy and Rick Covington were. Upon graduation, they gave us a curious gift, a sort-of children's book called *Hope for the Flowers*.

It was a yellow book cartoonishly illustrated with flowers, caterpillars, and the like.
