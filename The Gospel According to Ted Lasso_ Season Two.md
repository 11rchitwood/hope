# Episode 1: Goodbye Earl {#episode-1:-goodbye-earl}

The episode starts midseason, as Richmond has drawn their last seven games. Dani prepares to kick a game-winning penalty, but he accidentally kills Richmond's greyhound mascot Earl; his resulting guilt cripples his ability to play. To help Dani recover from his "yips", Richmond hires sports psychologist Sharon Fieldstone, whose stern and disciplined attitude clashes with Ted. After meeting with Sharon, Dani regains his enthusiasm for football and converts a corner kick goal in practice. As a result, more players begin to request sessions with Sharon. Meanwhile, a newly retired Roy is coaching an Under 9 Girls Football team and dating Keeley. Jamie is shown to be a contestant on Lust Conquers All, a Love Island-style reality show.

## Football is Death {#football-is-death}

Scene: Dani kills Earl. 3:10 to 5:30.

***Ted Lasso** \- It's funny to think about the things in your life that can make you cry just knowing that they existed, can then become the same thing that makes you cry knowing that they're now gone.*

“Death is a part of life.” It’s an oft repeated phrase, but when we’re in the midst of death, that aphorism doesn’t really help. Dani is the “golden retriever” of AFC Richmond. Always happy. Always excited to be there. Always enjoying whatever is in front of him. And then he kills the team mascot. It’s a freak accident, no doubt, but this traumatic event shakes Dani to the core. The once happy-go-lucky footballer now has the yips. He can barely even dribble the ball\!

Losing someone will change you. The end of something is, by definition, the beginning of something new. When Jesus died on the cross, the disciples didn’t know how to act. Think about it from their perspective. These were mostly blue collar guys: fishermen, maybe some farmers, a tax collector. These men didn’t start out with a “Kingdom of God” mindset. Nevertheless, Jesus made them the founders of our faith.

Jesus predicted his own death three times in scripture. The first time he did occurs just after Peter proudly declares that Jesus is not just some prophet. He is the Messiah, the son of the Living God.

31 He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. 32 He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.

33 But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. “Get behind me, Satan\!” he said. “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”

Another complete 180º turn\! Can you imagine? Jesus’s biggest fan can’t grasp that Jesus too is going to die. He won’t just die; he’ll be killed. Do you think Peter even understood what “rise again” meant?

We are Peter. We are Dani too. We can’t face death, at least not at first, and definitely not on our own. But as believers, we know that death is not the end. We all inherit resurrection from the Son of Man. Death is a loss, but it is also a gain. It’s an opportunity to grow, to live out the memory of those that we have lost, and to look forward to our own resurrection.

* What is the greatest loss you’ve ever felt in life?  
* How did you process that loss?  
* What does it mean to you now?

## Listen {#listen}

Scene: Girl Talk. 16:55 to 18:25.

***Rebecca Welton** \- Ted, would you please stop.*  
***Ted Lasso** \-* Rule number one: Even though it's called "girl talk," sometimes it needs to be more like, “Girl, listen\!”

The next time you’re conversing with someone consider this fact: it only takes about six seconds before you’ll stop listening and start thinking about what you’re going to say next. Six seconds. It’s a shockingly short amount of time.

Unsurprisingly, Ted seems to be just as susceptible to this phenomenon as the next person. At his first chance to have “girl talk” with Rebecca, he keeps interrupting her. No doubt he is excited, but after she corrects him, he changes course. For the rest of the conversation, he reassures her and asks genuine questions. He even spells it right out for us, “Okay, so rule number two is sometimes girl talk can just be blabbing away about stuff, and nothing has to really change, and no one has to solve anything?” That’s exactly right.

It turns out the wisdom of girl talk is scriptural. James 1:19 says, “Let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.” Consider this, we have the ultimate listener in Christ. He listens to our every prayer, even our every thought. He knows the meditations of our heart and gives us the ability to introspect or to be seen by other believers. The next time you’re talking to someone, remember: “Girl, listen.”

* Are you a good listener? Who is the best listener you know?  
* What are some good “girl talk” questions you can add to your conversational toolkit?

## 

## Football is Football {#football-is-football}

Scene: Football is football. 33:50 to 34:35.

	***Ted Lasso** \- I’m just curious. What did she– I mean, what ended up helping you?*  
***Dani Rojas** \- Dr. Sharon helped me remember that even though football is life, football is*  
*also death. And that football is football too. But mostly football is life\!*

Dani is broken, but is he broken forever? Fortunately not. Ted tries his normal tactics: a walk with Dani, having him practice the fundamentals, even a meeting with the Diamond Dogs. None of it works until Higgins asks, “Ted, what are your thoughts on therapy?”

Therapy can feel like a big deal, and maybe it is. The truth is this: When trauma happens, we all need to talk it out. It doesn’t look the same for everyone. Ted was betrayed by his former couples therapist. “All people are different people.” Beard quotes Ted back to himself. It’s hard to hear your own advice sometimes.

Enter Dr. Sharon Fieldstone. She immediately doesn’t fit in with the group, but that turns out to be a good thing. With her help, Dani climbs over the mountain of grief. Ted doesn’t really get to see how, but that’s kinda the point. This is Dani’s journey, not Ted’s.

Dani emerges as a new man. Well, still the same, chanting his name and zooming around the pitch. To paraphrase, football is life, football is also death, and football is football too. Why does this sound familiar?

Read Ecclesiastes 3:1-6 NIV. 

* What are your thoughts on therapy?  
* “All people are different people.” Do you ever struggle following your own advice sometimes?

# 

# Episode 2: Lavender {#episode-2:-lavender}

Jamie is voted out of Lust Conquers All, and unsuccessfully attempts a return to Manchester City. Higgins hires Sharon for the rest of the season. Jamie asks Ted to rejoin Richmond and reveals that he left Manchester City to irritate his abusive father. Ted politely declines his request to rejoin. When a picture of their conversation goes viral, Sam believes Jamie, who repeatedly bullied him, is returning and angrily storms off during practice. Ted assures Sam that he said no. After the girls' team Roy coaches lose their championship, Keeley convinces Roy to try out a pundit job at Sky Sports. Despite his heavy cursing drawing the disapproval of his other pundits, Roy's commentary is positively received by the public, and the network asks him to return. Wanting to give Jamie a second chance, Ted reconsiders adding him to the team and polls the Diamond Dogs on their opinions. Higgins votes for the addition, while Beard and Nate vote against it. Roy admits to Keeley that he enjoyed being on the show. Jamie rejoins Richmond, to the players' confusion.

## Punching Down {#punching-down}

Scene: Nate berates Will, the new kit-man. 3:45 to 5:00.

	***Nate** \- \[scoffs\] We don’t want calm athletes. We want killer athletes.*  
	***Beard** \- Even after they shower?*  
	***Nate** \- Did you sleep here?*  
	***Beard** \- Perchance to dream here?*

Nate, the lowly kit-man, has been promoted. He is now Coach Nate. You’d think he’d be grateful, but instead he immediately uses the opportunity to mistreat those below him, namely Will, the new kit-man. Why are we like this? The moment we reach new heights, we look around to see who’s just below us. This is not a new problem. Enter the unforgiving servant…

Read Matthew 18:21-35.

The unforgiving servant has just had his debt of *millions* of dollars canceled. For context, this is no lowly servant. He’s probably among the ruling class, a governor or something like that. He’s clearly not been wise with his money, but his master (likely a king) forgives his debts. Just like Coach Nate, he immediately mistreats the next guy below him, someone who’s in the position he was just in\! This won’t end well for the servant. We’ll keep watching to see how Nate’s story unfolds.

* Why does Nate mistreat Will?  
* What will it take for Nate to change his ways?

## 

## Prodigal Jamie {#prodigal-jamie}

Scene: Jamie seeks out Ted. 17:00 to 20:00.

	***Ted** \- Nice to see you, Jamie. Take a seat. How ya been?*  
	***Jamie** \- Awesome. The best. Pretty good. Okay, a little depressed. It’s all sh\*t, Ted.*  
	***Ted** \- That was quite the rollercoaster. Glad I was tall enough to join you on that ride.*

Jamie is lost. He left Man City because of his dad. He was voted off of Lust Island, cut from Man City, and now he’s at rock bottom. He reaches out to Keeley because he doesn’t know where to go, and she directs him to Ted. Finally, this leads to rumors of Jamie’s return, and Sam is hurt at the thought of it. Ultimately, Sam makes Ted realize that Jamie deserves a second chance, and we see Jamie return to Richmond at the end of the episode.

Read Luke 15:11-32.

Jamie is the prodigal son, plain and simple. Sam seems like the jealous brother. Ted isn’t like the generous father, at least not at first. When Sam tells him how his father is grateful for Ted, Ted knows that he has to show up for Jamie.

* Can everyone be redeemed? Why or why not?  
* How would you balance rescuing one lost sheep at the expense of another?

## Generosity {#generosity}

Higgins is one of those folks that would do anything for anybody. He freely gives up his office for Dr. Sharon, and throughout the episode we see him wandering about the complex, working wherever he can. Higgins embodies Luke 6:38:

“Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you”

Higgins embodies servant leadership. He is the Director of Football Operations and the guy that probably knows where the bodies are buried at the Racetrack. Why should he be generous to anyone? Well, God made him that way, and we can all learn from that. I hope we see Higgins reap what he sows this season.

* Who is the most generous person you know?  
* How can we be more generous to each other in this group?

## The Ever After {#the-ever-after}

Scene: Roy’s television debut.

***Roy Kent** \- I don’t wanna be a f\*\*\*ing football pundit sat on f\*\*\*ing telly in a dumb f\*\*\*ing suit like a know-it-all…*

All of life is transitions. At least that’s what it feels like. When you’re in the middle, in your grove, you’re cruising. You don’t notice much. But in the transitions… that’s where the growth lies.

Roy is in the biggest transition of his life. His football career is over. It was only a few short months ago that he even started to consider his identity outside of football when Phoebe told him all about himself at Keeley’s behest. Roy can’t stay away from the game, so he’s berating 8-year-old girls on the pitch instead of his teammates. And he seems to be enjoying it, but Keeley, his better half, sees something more in him. She has him try being a pundit, and he crushes it, to no one’s surprise except his own.

Jesus saw something more in his disciples. He called them from their normal lives to take up his charge and follow him. When Jesus’ time on this world was over, they still didn’t really grasp the mission he was leaving in their care. In Acts 1, they clearly think Jesus is going to fix everything right away.

Read Acts 1:6-11.

The disciples just didn’t get it… yet. Neither does Roy. But give it time. Both will soon realize that they have been called to a greater commission, and they have all they need to succeed.

* What has been your biggest life transition? How did it affect your faith journey?  
* Has anyone ever seen spiritual gifts in you that you didn’t recognize in yourself? How are you using those gifts now?

# Episode 3: Do the Right-est Thing {#episode-3:-do-the-right-est-thing}

The team does not take kindly to Jamie's return, despite his attempts to apologize for his past behavior. On Keeley's advice, Jamie visits Sharon. Sassy's daughter (and Rebecca's goddaughter) Nora comes to visit and spends a day with Rebecca at work. Sam participates in a photo shoot for Dubai Air, the team's sponsor, but later learns from his father that Dubai Air is owned by an oil company polluting his home country of Nigeria. He withdraws from the ad campaign, prompting pressure on Rebecca from Dubai Air to fire Sam; but she holds firm at Nora's urging. During Richmond's next game, Sam and fellow Nigerian players Isaac and Winchester cover their uniforms' Dubai Air logos with tape in protest. Jamie leads the rest of the team to follow suit. Ted lets Sam speak about Dubai Air's malfeasance and the Nigerian government's corruption during the postgame press conference. Jamie toasts Sam for his courage, and the two reconcile.

## Biscuits {#biscuits}

	***Nora*** \- Oh, I’ve never seen a horse fly. I saw a horse pee once… that was a lot.  
	***Ted*** \- Yeah. Noisy too.

Why biscuits every morning? Even when things are not right or even when they are. New experiences and new people appear in Rebecca’s office but the one constant every morning is bread i.e. biscuits. Wonder what that’s about?

What is the best bread you’ve ever had in your life? Who baked it? What made it so good?

In John 6 Jesus says, “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever, and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”

What in the world is Jesus talking about and do you think the disciples got it? Do we get it each time we celebrate communion and eat the bread of life? 

Is Ted giving a part of himself every day to Rebecca or is it just BREAD? 

We don’t live by bread alone, but we also don’t live long without it. To eat is to acknowledge our dependence both on food and on each other. It also reminds us of other kinds of emptiness that even the blue-plate special can’t touch.

We would not have bread or food without the work of many, many others. We depend on others for our food and most of the time do not ever think about this.

We would not know of God’s love for us without the life of Christ. Jesus was God’s cooking up love for us and serving it in a most spectacular manner. 

Evidently Ted’s biscuits are pretty good also.

## Jesus or John Wooden? {#jesus-or-john-wooden?}

Scene: Ted meets Nora. 0:00 to 2:21.

***Ted*** \- What do you say we do what the man says and make today our masterpiece?

Ted drops a little wisdom from one of the greatest coaches of all time. Ted is well studied in the art of coaching, but is the man Ted refers to Jesus or John Wooden?

“Success comes from knowing that you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.” \- John Wooden

To Ted, making each day your masterpiece means focusing on what you are doing right now to the best of your ability. It is recognizing nothing can be done about what happened yesterday, and that you can only affect what will happen tomorrow by what you do today.

Reminds me of practicing being a Goldfish at times. Jesus never mentions Goldfish but he certainly talks a lot about being present to the here and now.

“This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.” (Psalm 118:24)

* When are you best able to make today your masterpiece?  
* What helps you be fully present in your relationships and work on a daily basis?  
* How can God help you with this?

## On the Shoulders of Giants {#on-the-shoulders-of-giants}

Scene: Rebecca walking with Nora. 9:15 to 13:19.

***Roy*** \- Look, most adults think kids need to be constantly entertained. It’s bullsh\*t. I didn’t need a f\*\*\*ing parade every day growing up, did you? Truth is, they just want to feel like they’re part of our lives. Little idiots.

Who have been the mentors in your life? Rebecca is the mentor (godmother) for Nora. Ted sees himself as a mentor to Jamie. Roy is for his niece, Phoebe.

Notice how Nora lights up when Rebecca asks her to shadow her on a regular, boring work day. Likewise, Rebecca beams when she realizes that their relationship is beginning anew.

Mentors often give their mentees help, support, and advice over a period of time. It ultimately is about forming a relationship that both find mutually meaningful and satisfying. Both usually benefit and perhaps even grow to love one another over time. Who are you a mentor for? How have you benefited from receiving or offering mentoring? Who have been your best mentors?

## Do the Right Thing {#do-the-right-thing}

Scene: Sam duct tapes his jersey. 29:40 to credits.

When we think about God’s promises to us we often focus on blessings, forgiveness, mercy and perhaps even eternal life among others. But Jesus promised us something else as well, “You will have suffering in this world.” (John 16:33)

In this episode, Sam finds out that Nigeria, his home country, is suffering because of a mega corporation’s wrongdoing, and no one on the team was aware that their main sponsor was party to such acts.

Once they became aware they unified around the protest and raised the awareness for the world of this situation. Rebecca stands firm against the sponsor’s CEO, one of Rupert’s cronies. The Nigerian players, Issac, Sam, and Winchester, duct tape over their uniforms in protest. The tide really turns when Jamie joins in solidarity.

* Have you ever protested against what you perceived as evil? How did it turn out?  
* The early Christians suffered and were tortured, killed, and crucified for their beliefs. Have you ever suffered for a cause or suffered for what you believed?

# Episode 4: Carol of the Bells {#episode-4:-carol-of-the-bells}

On Christmas Day, Ted unsuccessfully tries to spend time over the phone with Henry and Michelle and becomes dejected and starts drinking afterwards. Suspecting Ted would feel alone on his first post-divorce Christmas, Rebecca brings him along to give gifts to underprivileged children across town. Roy and Keeley learn Phoebe's classmate is bullying her for bad breath. They trace the problem to the antihistamine she takes for a cat allergy and take Phoebe to make amends with her bully using handwritten posters. Higgins and his family host a Christmas party for foreign players who are unable to visit their families at home. As the party ends, Ted and Rebecca – joined by a street band they gave money to earlier – sing Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) to the team from outside the Higgins' house.

## I’ll Be Home for Christmas {#i’ll-be-home-for-christmas}

Scene: Higgins family Christmas. 6:30 to …

	***Higgins** \- So, Sam, back home, what does Christmas make you think of?*  
	***Sam** \- Colonization.*  
	***Higgins** \- Of course.*

The Higgins family makes a home for all.

Christmas means something different to everyone. We each build our own traditions. Some are on purpose while others are organic. Higgins and his family open their doors each holiday season to any players who are away from home. This speaks to the generosity in spirit that Higgins has, and now we see how that is share by his whole family.

Have you ever been welcomed by someone you wouldn’t expect during a lonesome time? How did that feel? How can we emulate Higgins and his family’s hospitality?

## The Longest Night of the Year {#the-longest-night-of-the-year}

Ted is spending his first Christmas Day alone, but Rebecca comes calling at the window in the nick of time.

The holidays can be some of the darkest, loneliest times of the year, especially for those who have lost a loved one recently. One church I used to attend held a service during Advent season called *The Longest Night*. It was a space for those grieving loss during Christmas.

Jesus came into the world at a dark hour to bring light to all creation at the first Christmas.

How can we check on someone in need during the holidays or other difficult anniversaries?

## Door to Door {#door-to-door}

Roy, Keeley, and Phoebe go door to door. 

Mary and Joseph look for somewhere to stay in Bethlehem.

Is it more enjoyable to give or receive?

How can you be more generous this Christmas season?

## Your Favorite Christmas Song {#your-favorite-christmas-song}

Music has the power to bring us all together, especially at Christmas time. The end song of this episode is campy to say the least, as many popular Christmas songs are, but I think it speaks to the joy and hope of Christmastime.

On the first Christmas, the skies opened up with choirs of angels. This too was a big celebration.

What are your favorite Christmas songs? Are there any cheesy ones that still move you?

# Episode 5: Rainbow {#episode-5:-rainbow}

Nate timidly tries and fails to book a window seat at his parents' favorite restaurant for their anniversary. After Rebecca and Keeley teach Nate to be more assertive and confident, he successfully obtains the window reservation. Rebecca becomes interested in her new match on Bantr, an anonymous dating app co-owned by Keeley and Richmond's new sponsor. Richmond continues to struggle, in part due to team captain Isaac's anxiety hampering his leadership. Roy helps him by taking him and Ted to a field near his childhood home and having Isaac play a pickup match with neighborhood footballers, reminding him to have fun while playing. While commentating on his Soccer Saturday show, Roy watches a newly enthusiastic Isaac on the pitch and realizes he misses being involved with the game. He abruptly leaves the broadcast and makes his way to Richmond's stadium, where he joins Ted's coaching staff, to the applause of the Richmond supporters and the chagrin of Nate.

## She’s a Rainbow. What’s your brand? {#she’s-a-rainbow.-what’s-your-brand?}

Higgin’s ringtone for his beloved wife is “She’s a Rainbow” but the Rolling Stones. Do you have a special ringtone for someone special? Mine for Lissa is “Still the One” by Orleans.

Scene: Higgins tells the story of meeting his wife. 11:15 to 12:40.

What is the best brand of oneself? Being yourself. Higgins gets it. How do you want to represent yourself? In church, at home, at work, and in other contexts. Folks with integrity are the same no matter the context. There’s a beatitude about this, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.” (Matthew 5:8 NIV). Would people in each are of your life all use the same words to describe you? Why or why not?

# Episode 6: The Signal {#episode-6:-the-signal}

Rebecca is visited by her mother, who recently left her father. Rebecca tells Ted that her parents repeatedly separate and reconcile every few years. Beard and Jane get back together, and Higgins is advised by Ted and Roy not to voice his apprehensions. Richmond enjoys newfound success with Roy on the coaching staff, but Jamie is upset that Roy refuses to give him coaching advice. Roy eventually relents and tells Jamie he needs to play more aggressively "when appropriate" and that the coaches will provide him a signal for when to do so. In a close game against Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-final of the FA Cup, all four coaches give Jamie the signal – raising their middle finger at him – leading to his scoring a goal to end the first half. As the second half becomes intense, Ted suddenly has a panic attack and leaves the pitch, leaving Richmond in disarray, and the Spurs score, tying the game. Without Ted, Nate steps in and calls a triple substitution that leads to a game-winning score for Richmond. Sharon finds Ted in her office asking for help.

## Setting the tone {#setting-the-tone}

Scene: Ted arrives at work. 2:50 to 4:00.

As Ted arrives at the AFC Richmond Offices he greets EVERYONE with a smile and an enthusiastic interchange. He appears to be setting the tone for his day. As the coach of the team we know that he sets the tone for the office and the players on the team. He relates to each in a way that lets them know he knows what’s happening in their lives and makes each exchange personable and uplifting.

Is this just Ted’s personality or is this an intentional way to infuse positive energy into the day as he encounters each person.

Have you ever worked with someone like this? Have you ever been like this? Do you see this as authentic or superficial?

Do we as Christians have any responsibility for setting the tone in the relationships and working situations in which we find ourselves?

Parker Palmer writes “ a leader is a person who has an unusual degree of power to project on other people his or her shadow or his or her light. A leader is a person who has an unusual degree of power to create conditions under which other people must live and move and have their being—conditions that can either be as illuminating as heaven or as shadowy as hell. A leader is a person who must take special responsibility for what’s going on inside of him or her self, inside his or her consciousness, lest the act of leadership create more harm than good.”

1 Corinthians 16:13-14, Psalms 118:24, 1 John 4:7-8, Romans 12:10

## Relationship interference or intervention {#relationship-interference-or-intervention}

Scene: Office conversation. 5:00 to 7:20.

Higgins' comment about Jane and Beard receives a major reaction from all the other Diamond Dogs. He confronts the others that they did not back him up when he raised his concerns with Coach Beard.

Read Matthew 18:15. It appears he is following the Good Book directions in his challenging them in the office.

What do you think of the approach that Ted and the others take toward the situation?

Is it bad business to get all up in someone else’s business when it comes to relationships?

What has been your experience with giving or receiving advice concerning significant relationships or other life experiences?

When is it appropriate for us to offer our input to others as it relates to their lives or their relationships?

Hebrews 13:16, Galatians 6:9, Galatians 6:2

## Why won’t you coach me? Learning to relate to difficult people {#why-won’t-you-coach-me?-learning-to-relate-to-difficult-people}

Scene: Jamie and Roy. 15:30 to 18:20.

Jamie talks with Keely and others, and he decides to try her advice on how to relate to Roy and get him to coach him. He tries to agree with everything Roy says and Roy has a fun time with this as he seeks to deal with Jamie’s ego, especially when it comes to his hair, in a rather non constructive manner.

Have you ever tried this method of dealing with difficult people by agreeing with them? How did that work out for you?

What have you found that helps in dealing with difficult people and relationships?

What have you found that does not help in these situations?

Matthew 5:44, 2 Timothy 2:24, Ephesians 4:32

## 

## The Signal {#the-signal}

Scene: Bird time. 21:00 to 23:50.

Ted struggles with the signal but follows through and good things happen when Jamie is set free to be the prick he is.

Has any good ever happened in our life on occasion when you’ve been a prick? Can or has God ever used that for good?

Romans 8:28

Life is short and we do not have much time to gladden the hearts of those who travel with us… So be swift to love, make haste to be kind, and go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

# Episode 7: Headspace {#episode-7:-headspace}

Ted's first two sessions with Sharon prove fruitless. He leaves the first almost immediately and storms out of the second after expressing his skepticism and contempt towards psychotherapy after couples therapy failed to save his marriage. During the third visit, however, Ted apologizes for his outburst and decides to commit to the therapy process. Roy begins spending every moment he can with Keeley, to the point where she feels smothered. The two fight after Roy learns that Keeley has been complaining about his overbearing behavior to Rebecca and others. Thanks to a remark from Jamie, Roy comes to understand that Keeley needs space and makes amends by running her a candlelit rose bath to enjoy on her own. Nate sees himself going viral on Twitter and being dubbed the "Wonder Kid" in the media for the triple-substitution that resulted in Richmond's recent win, but his insecurity worsens when his stern father advises humility instead of praising his achievement. As a result, Nate begins behaving cruelly to others in the locker room – first to Colin, a young Welsh player who used to bully him, and later to Will, the new kit man.

## I need some space\! {#i-need-some-space!}

Scene: Keeley and Roy blow up. 20:10 to 22:35.

Sometimes I wonder if Jesus was an introvert. At the peak of his ministry, crowds followed him everywhere. He surely spent much of his time with the disciples. He spent much of his time healing the sick, performing miracles, teaching, and preaching. However, there are several examples from gospel stories where Jesus takes time away from people to pray and recharge.

* Matthew 14:23 – “After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone.”  
* Mark 1:35 – “Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.”  
* Luke 5:16 – “But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.”  
* Luke 6:12 – “One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.”

It’s no wonder that Keeley needs some space from Roy.   
How do you recharge? How do you help give others in your life space to do the same?

## Not-so-wonderful Wonder Kid {#not-so-wonderful-wonder-kid}

Scene: Beard confronts Nate. 22:35 to 24:00.

	***Beard** \- You were rude to Colin. Not just rude. It was personal and weird.*  
	***Nate** \- You’re absolutely right… did you tell Ted?*  
	***Beard** \- No, this is just between you and me. Do better.*

How do you know when to do the right thing and check your peers?

## Tell the truth {#tell-the-truth}

Scene: Ted’s third session. 24:10 to 27:00.

	***Ted** \- Maybe I don’t wanna learn the truth.*  
	***Dr. Sharon** \- Ted, the truth will set you free, but first it’ll piss you off.*

Have you ever tried to start a workout cold? It doesn’t usually go well for me. I need some time to warm up. It’s the same with Ted. He’s afraid of therapy. It’s associated with past trauma for him. He needs a warm-up too. But he doesn’t quit.

Is there a correct way of doing therapy?
